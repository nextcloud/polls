### Install from git
If you want to run the latest development version from git source, you need to clone the repo to your apps folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/polls.git
```

* Install dev environment with ```make setup-dev``` or
* install runtime environment with ```make setup-build```
* Compile javascript with ```npm run build```
* Run a complete build with ```make appstore``` (Find the output in the build directory)
* call `occ app:enable polls` to enable Polls

### Installation variants

### First time install
Nextcloud executes
* unexecuteted `migration classes` (not listed in the `*_migrations` table) and the 
* `install` repair step.

### After a version update (changed version attribute in appinfo/info.xml)
Nextcloud executes 
* `pre-migration` repair steps, 
* unexecuteted `migration classes` (not listed in the `*_migrations` table) and the 
* `post-migration` repair steps

### Enabling already installed but disabled app without version change
Nextcloud executes 
* `pre-migration` repair steps, 
* unexecuteted `migration classes` (not listed in the `*_migrations` table) and the
* `post-migration` repair steps and the 
* `install` repair step

‚ùó As a compromise at the moment we allow the index creation to be ran twice when enabling the app via app store or `occ`, to ensure all indexes are created properly for every install/update/enabling path.

## Removing Polls from instance
Call `occ polls:db:purge` to remove Polls completely. 
* removes all Polls related tables
* removes all Polls related migration records
* removes all Polls related app config records (this also disables Polls)

This does not remove Polls' files (call `occ app:remove polls` to remove it complete afterwards) but it resets Polls into an 'uninstalled' state. Enabling the app is then equivalent to a first time install and calls the migration and the install repair step (see above).
